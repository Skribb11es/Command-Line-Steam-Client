# Command-Line-Steam-Client
Yes I know that SteamCMD exists, and yes I am aware how much worse this is in comparison. Long story short I got bored and needed something to do so I did this.

## Commands
```
help / cmds / commands
Does exactly what you expect it to do, it lists the avalable commands with basic explanations of each.
```
```
launch
Again exactly what it sounds like, a very simple command to launch the desired game input into the command line. Its input is case sensitive.
```
```
list
Why am I even writing docs for this, it just lists all the games found.
```
```
close
Wow do I ever need something else to do, closes the application.
```
